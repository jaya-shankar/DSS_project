# DSS_project
As a part of assignment we designed a DSS to assign risk weight to each of the state in USA based on different criteria



## Preprocessing:
- using Covid19_Hospital_Data_Coverage dataset created a new csv hospital count which contains the count of hospital in each state
- Data consisted of 15 unique parameters. Hence, Pandas and Mongo DB was used.
## To keep in mind:
- The dataset Covid19_Hospital_Data_Coverage has also types of hospital(short term, long term, critical care) etc (did not include in this project).

# Conclusion
Since Covid-19 is a serious issue for the people, we have assessed some factors that shows impact of Covid-19 risk.
Our DSS model could predict the risk of states in USA with an accuracy of 97.6% and log loss of about 0.0801 by considering the data from reliable sources. 
With proper planning and by using the DSS model developed, the federal government can save the people in demand to supply the required essentials.
Finally the model could also provide generalized results of risk estimation not only for USA and for other countries too. This could serve
the people in crisis due to Covid-19.
